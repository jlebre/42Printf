42 Cursus Printf

This was the second project I made at 42 Lisbon. The goal was to recreate the behavior of the **printf** function.

Since we can (or should) not use the real **printf** during the Cursus, this is a great function to add to your library.

It helped to better understand how the it works and each one of it's many aspects.
